C API for Handwritten Code
==========================

In this section we describe the API that can be used by handwritten code in
specification files.


.. c:macro:: SIP_API_MAJOR_NR

    This is a C preprocessor symbol that defines the major number of the SIP
    API.  Its value is a number.  There is no direct relationship between this
    and the SIP version number.


.. c:macro:: SIP_API_MINOR_NR

    This is a C preprocessor symbol that defines the minor number of the SIP
    API.  Its value is a number.  There is no direct relationship between this
    and the SIP version number.


.. c:macro:: SIP_BLOCK_THREADS

    This is a C preprocessor macro that will make sure the Python Global
    Interpreter Lock (GIL) is acquired.  Python API calls must only be made
    when the GIL has been acquired.  There must be a corresponding
    :c:macro:`SIP_UNBLOCK_THREADS` at the same lexical scope.


.. c:macro:: SIP_NO_CONVERTORS

    This is a flag used by various type convertors that suppresses the use of a
    type's :directive:`%ConvertToTypeCode`.


.. c:macro:: SIP_NOT_NONE

    This is a flag used by various type convertors that causes the conversion
    to fail if the Python object being converted is ``Py_None``.


.. c:macro:: SIP_NULLPTR

    .. versionadded:: 4.19.14

    This is a C preprocessor macro that should be used instead of ``NULL`` or
    ``nullptr``.  It ensures the correct value is used depending on whether C
    or C++ is being generated and which language standard the compiler
    supports.


.. c:macro:: SIP_OWNS_MEMORY

    .. versionadded:: 4.15.2

    This is a flag used by various array constructors that species that the
    array owns the memory that holds the array's contents.


.. c:macro:: SIP_PROTECTED_IS_PUBLIC

    .. versionadded:: 4.10

    This is a C preprocessor symbol that is defined automatically by the build
    system to specify that the generated code is being compiled with
    ``protected`` redefined as ``public``.  This allows handwritten code to
    determine if the generated helper functions for accessing protected C++
    functions are available (see :directive:`%MethodCode`).


.. c:macro:: SIP_READ_ONLY

    .. versionadded:: 4.15.2

    This is a flag used by various array constructors that species that the
    array is read-only.


.. c:function:: SIP_RELEASE_GIL(sip_gilstate_t sipGILState)

    .. versionadded:: 4.14.4

    This is called from the handwritten code specified with the
    :directive:`VirtualErrorHandler` in order to release the Python Global
    Interpreter Lock (GIL) prior to changing the execution path (e.g. by
    throwing a C++ exception).  It should not be called under any other
    circumstances.

    :param sipGILState:
        an opaque value provided to the handwritten code by SIP.


.. c:macro:: SIP_SSIZE_T

    This is a C preprocessor macro that is defined as ``Py_ssize_t`` for Python
    v2.5 and later, and as ``int`` for earlier versions of Python.  It makes it
    easier to write PEP 353 compliant handwritten code.


.. c:macro:: SIP_SSIZE_T_FORMAT

    .. versionadded:: 4.15.4

    This is a C preprocessor macro that is defined as ``%zd`` for Python
    v2.5 and later, and as ``%d`` for earlier versions of Python.  It makes it
    easier to write PEP 353 compliant handwritten code.


.. c:macro:: SIP_UNBLOCK_THREADS

    This is a C preprocessor macro that will restore the Python Global
    Interpreter Lock (GIL) to the state it was prior to the corresponding
    :c:macro:`SIP_BLOCK_THREADS`.


.. c:macro:: SIP_USE_PYCAPSULE

    .. versionadded:: 4.11

    This is a C preprocessor symbol that is defined when ``PyCapsule`` objects
    are being used rather than the (now deprecated) ``PyCObject`` objects.


.. c:macro:: SIP_VERSION

    This is a C preprocessor symbol that defines the SIP version number
    represented as a 3 part hexadecimal number (e.g. v5.0.0 is represented as
    ``0x050000``).


.. c:macro:: SIP_VERSION_STR

    This is a C preprocessor symbol that defines the SIP version number
    represented as a string.  For development versions it will contain either
    ``.dev`` or ``-snapshot-``.


.. c:function:: sipErrorState sipBadCallableArg(int arg_nr, PyObject *arg)

    .. versionadded:: 4.10

    This is called from :directive:`%MethodCode` to raise a Python exception
    when an argument to a function, a C++ constructor or method is found to
    have an unexpected type.  This should be used when the
    :directive:`%MethodCode` does additional type checking of the supplied
    arguments.

    :param arg_nr:
        the number of the argument.  Arguments are numbered from 0 but are
        numbered from 1 in the detail of the exception.
    :param arg:
        the argument.
    :return:
        the value that should be assigned to ``sipError``.


.. c:function:: void sipBadCatcherResult(PyObject *method)

    This raises a Python exception when the result of a Python reimplementation
    of a C++ method doesn't have the expected type.  It is normally called by
    handwritten code specified with the :directive:`%VirtualCatcherCode`
    directive.

    :param method:
        the Python method and would normally be the supplied ``sipMethod``.


.. c:function:: void sipBadLengthForSlice(SIP_SSIZE_T seqlen, SIP_SSIZE_T slicelen)

    This raises a Python exception when the length of a slice object is
    inappropriate for a sequence-like object.  It is normally called by
    handwritten code specified for :meth:`__setitem__` methods.

    :param seqlen:
        the length of the sequence.
    :param slicelen:
        the length of the slice.


.. c:type:: sipBufferInfoDef

    .. versionadded:: 4.19

    This C structure is used with :c:func:`sipGetBufferInfo()` and
    :c:func:`sipReleaseBufferInfo()` and encapsulates information provided by a
    Python object that implements the buffer protocol.  The structure elements
    are as follows.

    .. c:member:: void \*bi_buf

        The address of the buffer.

    .. c:member:: PyObject \*bi_obj

        A reference to the object that implements the buffer protocol.

    .. c:member:: SIP_SSIZE_T bi_len

        The length of the buffer in bytes.

    .. c:member:: char \*bi_format

        The format of each element of the buffer.


.. c:function:: PyObject *sipBuildResult(int *iserr, const char *format, ...)

    This creates a Python object based on a format string and associated
    values in a similar way to the Python :c:func:`Py_BuildValue()` function.

    :param iserr:
        if this is not ``NULL`` then the location it points to is set to a
        non-zero value.
    :param format:
        the string of format characters.
    :return:
        If there was an error then ``NULL`` is returned and a Python exception
        is raised.
        
    If the format string begins and ends with parentheses then a tuple of
    objects is created.  If it contains more than one format character then
    parentheses must be specified.

    In the following description the first letter is the format character, the
    entry in parentheses is the Python object type that the format character
    will create, and the entry in brackets are the types of the C/C++ values
    to be passed.

    ``B`` (wrapped instance) [*type* \*, :c:type:`sipWrapperType` \*, PyObject \*]
        .. deprecated:: 4.8
            Use ``N`` instead.

        Convert a new C structure or a new C++ class instance to a Python class
        instance object.  Ownership of the structure or instance is determined
        by the ``PyObject *`` argument.  If it is ``NULL`` and the instance has
        already been wrapped then the ownership is unchanged.  If it is
        ``NULL`` or ``Py_None`` then ownership will be with Python.  Otherwise
        ownership will be with C/C++ and the instance associated with the
        ``PyObject *`` argument.  The Python class is influenced by any

            Use ``D`` instead.

        Convert a C structure or a C++ class instance to a Python class
        instance object.  If the structure or class instance has already been
        wrapped then the result is a new reference to the existing class
        instance object.  Ownership of the structure or instance is determined
        by the ``PyObject *`` argument.  If it is ``NULL`` and the instance has
        already been wrapped then the ownership is unchanged.  If it is
        ``NULL`` and the instance is newly wrapped then ownership will be with
        C/C++.  If it is ``Py_None`` then ownership is transferred to Python
        via a call to :c:func:`sipTransferBack()`.  Otherwise ownership is
        transferred to C/C++ and the instance associated with the
        ``PyObject *`` argument via a call to :c:func:`sipTransferTo()`.  The
        Python class is influenced by any applicable
        :directive:`%ConvertToSubClassCode` code.

    ``D`` (wrapped instance) [*type* \*, const :c:type:`sipTypeDef` \*, PyObject \*]
        Convert a C structure, C++ class or mapped type instance to a Python
        object.  If the instance has already been wrapped then the result is a
        new reference to the existing object.  Ownership of the instance is
        determined by the ``PyObject *`` argument.  If it is ``NULL`` and the
        instance has already been wrapped then the ownership is unchanged.  If
        it is ``NULL`` and the instance is newly wrapped then ownership will be
        with C/C++.  If it is ``Py_None`` then ownership is transferred to
        Python via a call to :c:func:`sipTransferBack()`.  Otherwise ownership
        is transferred to C/C++ and the instance associated with the
        ``PyObject *`` argument via a call to :c:func:`sipTransferTo()`.  The
        Python class is influenced by any applicable
        :directive:`%ConvertToSubClassCode` code.

        Python named enum type.

    ``F`` (wrapped enum) [enum, :c:type:`sipTypeDef` \*]
        Convert a named C/C++ ``enum`` to an instance of the corresponding
        Python named enum type.

    ``G`` (unicode) [wchar_t \*, :c:macro:`SIP_SSIZE_T`]
        Convert a C/C++ wide character array and its length to a Python unicode

    ``N`` (wrapped instance) [*type* \*, :c:type:`sipTypeDef` \*, PyObject \*]
        Convert a new C structure, C++ class or mapped type instance to a
        Python object.  Ownership of the instance is determined by the
        ``PyObject *`` argument.  If it is ``NULL`` and the instance has
        already been wrapped then the ownership is unchanged.  If it is
        ``NULL`` or ``Py_None`` then ownership will be with Python.  Otherwise
        ownership will be with C/C++ and the instance associated with the
        ``PyObject *`` argument.  The Python class is influenced by any
        applicable :directive:`%ConvertToSubClassCode` code.

    ``R`` (object) [PyObject \*]
        The result is value passed without any conversions.  The reference
        count is unaffected, i.e. a reference is taken.

    If *transferObj* is ``Py_None`` then ownership is transferred to Python via
    a call to :c:func:`sipTransferBack()`.
    
    Otherwise ownership is transferred to C/C++ and the instance associated
    with *transferObj* via a call to :c:func:`sipTransferTo()`.
    
    The Python type is influenced by any applicable
    :directive:`%ConvertToSubClassCode` code.

    If *transferObj* is ``Py_None`` then ownership is transferred to Python
    via a call to :c:func:`sipTransferBack()`.
    
    Otherwise ownership is transferred to C/C++ and the instance associated
    with *transferObj* argument via a call to :c:func:`sipTransferTo()`.


.. c:function:: PyObject *sipConvertFromNamedEnum(int eval, PyTypeObject *type)

    .. deprecated:: 4.8

    :param transferObj:
        this controls the ownership of the returned value.
    :return:
        the Python object.

    If *transferObj* is ``NULL`` or ``Py_None`` then ownership will be with
    Python.
    
    Otherwise ownership will be with C/C++ and the instance associated with
    *transferObj*.

    :directive:`%ConvertToSubClassCode` code.


.. c:function:: PyObject *sipConvertFromNewPyType(void *cpp, PyTypeObject *py_type, sipWrapper *owner, sipSimpleWrapper **selfp, const char *format, ...)

    .. versionadded:: 4.15

    This converts a new C structure or a C++ class instance to an instance of a
    corresponding Python type (as opposed to the corresponding generated Python
    type).  This is useful when the C/C++ library provides some sort of
    mechanism whereby handwritten code has some control over the exact type of
    structure or class being created.  Typically it would be used to create an
    instance of the generated derived class which would then allow Python
    re-implementations of C++ virtual methods to function properly.

    :param cpp:
        the C/C++ instance.
    :param py_type:
        the Python type object.  This is called to create the Python object and
        is passed the arguments defined by the string of format characters.
    :param owner:
        is the optional owner of the Python object.
    :param selfp:
        is an optional pointer to the ``sipPySelf`` instance variable of the
        C/C++ instance if that instance's type is a generated derived class.
        Otherwise it should be ``NULL``.
    :param format:
        the string of format characters (see :c:func:`sipBuildResult()`).
    :return:
        the Python object.  If there was an error then ``NULL`` is returned and
        a Python exception is raised.


.. c:function:: PyObject *sipConvertFromNewType(void *cpp, const sipTypeDef *td, PyObject *transferObj)

    This converts a new C structure or a C++ class instance to an instance of
    the corresponding generated Python type.

    :param cpp:
        the C/C++ instance.
    :param td:
        the type's :ref:`generated type structure <ref-type-structures>`.
    :param transferObj:
        this controls the ownership of the returned value.
    :return:
        the Python object.

    If *transferObj* is ``NULL`` or ``Py_None`` then ownership will be with
    Python.
    
    Otherwise ownership will be with C/C++ and the instance associated with
    *transferObj*.
    
    The Python type is influenced by any applicable
    :directive:`%ConvertToSubClassCode` code.


.. c:function:: SIP_SSIZE_T sipConvertFromSequenceIndex(SIP_SSIZE_T idx, SIP_SSIZE_T len)

    This converts a Python sequence index (i.e. where a negative value refers
    to the offset from the end of the sequence) to a C/C++ array index.  If the
    index was out of range then a negative value is returned and a Python
    exception raised.

    :param idx:
        the sequence index.
    :param len:
        the length of the sequence.
    :return:
        the unsigned array index.


.. c:function:: int sipConvertFromSliceObject(PyObject *slice, SIP_SSIZE_T length, SIP_SSIZE_T *start, SIP_SSIZE_T *stop, SIP_SSIZE_T *step, SIP_SSIZE_T *slicelength)

    This is a thin wrapper around the Python :c:func:`PySlice_GetIndicesEx()`
    function provided to make it easier to write handwritten code that is
    compatible with SIP v3.x and versions of Python earlier that v2.3.


.. c:function:: PyObject *sipConvertFromType(void *cpp, const sipTypeDef *td, PyObject *transferObj)

    This converts a C structure or a C++ class instance to an instance of the
    corresponding generated Python type.

    :param cpp:
        the C/C++ instance.
    :param td:
        the type's :ref:`generated type structure <ref-type-structures>`.
    :param transferObj:
        this controls the ownership of the returned value.
    :return:
        the Python object.

    If the C/C++ instance has already been wrapped then the result is a new
    reference to the existing object.

    If *transferObj* is ``NULL`` and the instance has already been wrapped then
    the ownership is unchanged.
    
    If *transferObj* is ``NULL`` and the instance is newly wrapped then
    ownership will be with C/C++.
    
    If *transferObj* is ``Py_None`` then ownership is transferred to Python via
    a call to :c:func:`sipTransferBack()`.
    
    Otherwise ownership is transferred to C/C++ and the instance associated
    with *transferObj* via a call to :c:func:`sipTransferTo()`.
    
    The Python class is influenced by any applicable
    :directive:`%ConvertToSubClassCode` code.


.. c:function:: PyObject *sipConvertFromVoidPtr(void *cpp)

    This creates a :class:`sip.voidptr` object for a memory address.  The
    object will be writeable but has no associated size.

    :param cpp:
        the memory address.
    :return:
        the :class:`sip.voidptr` object.


.. c:function:: PyObject *sipConvertFromVoidPtrAndSize(void *cpp, SIP_SSIZE_T size)

    This creates a :class:`sip.voidptr` object for a memory address.  The
    object will be writeable and can be used as a mutable buffer object.
    
    :param cpp:
        the memory address.
    :param size:
        the size associated with the address.
    :return:
        the :class:`sip.voidptr` object.


.. c:function:: PyObject *sipConvertToArray(void *data, const char *format, SIP_SSIZE_T len, int flags)

    .. versionadded:: 4.15

    This converts a one dimensional array of fundamental types to a
    :class:`sip.array` object.

    An array is very like a Python :class:`memoryview` object.  The underlying
    memory is not copied and may be modified in situ.  Arrays support the
    buffer protocol and so can be passed to other modules, again without the
    underlying memory being copied.

    :class:`sip.array` objects are not supported by the :program:`sip` code
    generator.  They can only be created by handwritten code or by
    :func:`sip.voidptr.asarray`.

    :param data:
        the address of the start of the C/C++ array.
    :param format:
        the format, as defined by the :mod:`struct` module, of an array
        element.  At the moment only ``b`` (char), ``B`` (unsigned char),
        ``h`` (short), ``H`` (unsigned short), ``i`` (int),
        ``I`` (unsigned int), ``f`` (float) and ``d`` (double) are supported.
    :param len:
        the number of elements in the array.
    :param readonly:
        is non-zero if the array is read-only.
    :param flags:
        any combination of the :c:macro:`SIP_READ_ONLY` and
        :c:macro:`SIP_OWNS_MEMORY` flags.
    :return:
        the :class:`sip.array` object.


.. c:function:: int sipConvertToBool(PyObject *obj)

    .. versionadded:: 4.19.4

    This converts a Python object to an integer corresponding to a C++
    ``bool``.

    :param obj:
        the Python object to convert.
    :return:
        the boolean value as an integer.  ``1`` corresponds to ``true`` and
        ``0`` corresponds to ``false``.  ``-1`` is returned, and an exception
        is raised, if there was an error.


.. c:function:: int sipConvertToEnum(PyObject *obj, const sipTypeDef *td)

    .. versionadded:: 4.19.4

    This converts a Python object to the value of a named C/C++ ``enum``
    member.  If the enum is a C++11 scoped enum then the Python object must be
    a member of the enum.  Otherwise it may also be an ``int`` corresponding to
    the name of the member.

    :param obj:
        the Python object to convert.
    :param td:
        the enum's :ref:`generated type structure <ref-type-structures>`.
    :return:
        the integer value.  An exception is raised if there was an error.


.. c:function:: void *sipConvertToInstance(PyObject *obj, sipWrapperType *type, PyObject *transferObj, int flags, int *state, int *iserr)

    .. deprecated:: 4.8
        Use :c:func:`sipConvertToType()` instead.

    This converts a Python object to an instance of a C structure or C++ class
    assuming that a previous call to :c:func:`sipCanConvertToInstance()` has
    been successful.

    :param obj:
        the Python object.
    :param type:
        the type's :ref:`generated type object <ref-type-objects>`.
    :param transferObj:
        this controls any ownership changes to *obj*.
    :param flags:
        any combination of the :c:macro:`SIP_NOT_NONE` and
        :c:macro:`SIP_NO_CONVERTORS` flags.
    :param state:
        the state of the returned C/C++ instance is returned via this pointer.
    :param iserr:
        the error flag is passed and updated via this pointer.
    :return:
        the C/C++ instance.
    
    If *transferObj* is ``NULL`` then the ownership is unchanged.
    
    If *transferObj* is ``Py_None`` then ownership is transferred to Python via
    a call to :c:func:`sipTransferBack()`.
    
    Otherwise ownership is transferred to C/C++ and *obj* associated with
    *transferObj* via a call to :c:func:`sipTransferTo()`.

    If *state* is not ``NULL`` then the location it points to is set to
    describe the state of the returned C/C++ instance and is the value returned
    by any :directive:`%ConvertToTypeCode`.  The calling code must then release
    the value at some point to prevent a memory leak by calling
    :c:func:`sipReleaseInstance()`.

    If there is an error then the location *iserr* points to is set to a
    non-zero value.  If it was initially a non-zero value then the conversion
    isn't attempted in the first place.  (This allows several calls to be made
    that share the same error flag so that it only needs to be tested once
    rather than after each call.)


.. c:function:: void *sipConvertToMappedType(PyObject *obj, const sipMappedType *mt, PyObject *transferObj, int flags, int *state, int *iserr)

    .. deprecated:: 4.8
        Use :c:func:`sipConvertToType()` instead.

    This converts a Python object to an instance of a C structure or C++
    class that is implemented as a mapped type assuming that a previous call to
    :c:func:`sipCanConvertToMappedType()` has been successful.

    :param obj:
        the Python object.
    :param mt:
        the opaque structure returned by :c:func:`sipFindMappedType()`.
    :param transferObj:
        this controls any ownership changes to *obj*.
    :param flags:
        this may be the :c:macro:`SIP_NOT_NONE` flag.
    :param state:
        the state of the returned C/C++ instance is returned via this pointer.
    :param iserr:
        the error flag is passed and updated via this pointer.
    :return:
        the C/C++ instance.

    If *transferObj* is ``NULL`` then the ownership is unchanged.

    This converts a Python object to an instance of a C structure, C++ class or
    mapped type assuming that a previous call to :c:func:`sipCanConvertToType()`
    has been successful.

    :param obj:
        the Python object.
    :param td:
        the type's :ref:`generated type structure <ref-type-structures>`.
    :param transferObj:
        this controls any ownership changes to *obj*.

    :param state:
        the state of the returned C/C++ instance is returned via this pointer.
    :param iserr:

    If *transferObj* is ``NULL`` then the ownership is unchanged.  If it is
    ``Py_None`` then ownership is transferred to Python via a call to
    :c:func:`sipTransferBack()`.
    
    Otherwise ownership is transferred to C/C++ and *obj* associated with
    *transferObj* via a call to :c:func:`sipTransferTo()`.

    Note that *obj* can also be managed by the C/C++ instance itself, but this
    can only be achieved by using :c:func:`sipTransferTo()`.

    If *state* is not ``NULL`` then the location it points to is set to
    describe the state of the returned C/C++ instance and is the value returned
    by any :directive:`%ConvertToTypeCode`.  The calling code must then release

.. c:function:: PyObject *sipConvertToTypedArray(void *data, const sipTypeDef *td, const char *format, size_t stride, SIP_SSIZE_T len, int flags)

    .. versionadded:: 4.15

    This converts a one dimensional array of instances of a C structure, C++
    class or mapped type to a :class:`sip.array` object.

    An array is very like a Python :class:`memoryview` object but it's elements
    correspond to C structures or C++ classes.  The underlying memory is not
    copied and may be modified in situ.  Arrays support the buffer protocol and

        the format, as defined by the :mod:`struct` module, of an array
        element.
    :param stride:
        the size of an array element, including any padding.
    :param len:
        the number of elements in the array.
    :param flags:
        the optional :c:macro:`SIP_READ_ONLY` flag.
    :return:
        the :class:`sip.array` object.


.. c:function:: void *sipConvertToVoidPtr(PyObject *obj)

    This converts a Python object to a memory address.
    :c:func:`PyErr_Occurred()` must be used to determine if the conversion was
    successful.

    :param obj:
        the Python object which may be ``Py_None``, a :class:`sip.voidptr` or a
        :c:type:`PyCObject`.
    :return:
        the memory address.


.. c:type:: sipDateDef

    .. versionadded:: 4.19

    This C structure is used with :c:func:`sipGetDate()`,
    :c:func:`sipFromDate()`, :c:func:`sipGetDateTime()` and
    :c:func:`sipFromDateTime()` and encapsulates the components parts of a
    Python date.  The structure elements are as follows.

    .. c:member:: int pd_year

        The year.

    .. c:member:: int pd_month

        The month (1-12).

    .. c:member:: int pd_day

        The day (1-31).


.. c:function:: int sipEnableAutoconversion(const sipTypeDef *td, int enable)

    .. versionadded:: 4.14.7

    Instances of some classes may be automatically converted to other Python
    objects even though the class has been wrapped.  This allows that behaviour
    to be suppressed so that an instances of the wrapped class is returned
    instead.

    :param td:
        the type's :ref:`generated type structure <ref-type-structures>`.  This
        must refer to a class.
    :param enable:
        is non-zero if auto-conversion should be enabled for the type.  This is
        the default behaviour.
    :return:
        ``1`` or ``0`` depending on whether or not auto-conversion was
        previously enabled for the type.  This allows the previous state to be
        restored later on.  ``-1`` is returned, and a Python exception raised,
        if there was an error.


.. c:function:: int sipEnableGC(int enable)

    .. versionadded:: 4.19.1

    This enables or disables the Python garbarge collector.

    :param enable:
        is greater than ``0`` if the garbage collector should be enabled.
    :return:
        ``1`` or ``0`` depending on whether or not the garbage collector was
        previously enabled.  This allows the previous state to be restored
        later on.  ``-1`` is returned if there was an error.


.. c:function:: int sipEnableOverflowChecking(int enable)

    .. versionadded:: 4.19.4

    This enables or disables the checking for overflows when converting Python
    integer objects to C/C++ integer types.  When it is enabled an exception is
    raised when the value of a Python integer object is too large to fit in the
    corresponding C/C++ type.  By default it is disabled.

    :param enable:
        is greater than ``0`` if overflow checking should be enabled.
    :return:
        ``1`` or ``0`` depending on whether or not overflow chacking was
        previously enabled.  This allows the previous state to be restored
        later on.


.. c:function:: int sipExportSymbol(const char *name, void *sym)

    Python does not allow extension modules to directly access symbols in
    another extension module.  This exports a symbol, referenced by a name,
    that can subsequently be imported, using :c:func:`sipImportSymbol()`, by
    another module.

    :param name:
        the name of the symbol.
    :param sym:
        the value of the symbol.
    :return:
        0 if there was no error.  A negative value is returned if *name* is
        already associated with a symbol or there was some other error.

    :param type:
        the C/C++ declaration of the type.
    :return:
        the generated type object.  This will not change and may be saved in a
        static cache.  ``NULL`` is returned if the C/C++ type doesn't exist.

    <ref-enum-type-objects>` corresponding to a named unscoped C/C++ enum.

    :param type:
        the C/C++ declaration of the enum.
    :return:
        the generated Python type object.  This will not change and may be

        enum doesn't exist.


.. c:function:: const sipTypeDef *sipFindType(const char *type)

    This returns a pointer to the :ref:`generated type structure
    <ref-type-structures>` corresponding to a C/C++ type.

    :param type:
        the C/C++ declaration of the type.
    :return:
        the generated type structure.  This will not change and may be saved in
        a static cache.  ``NULL`` is returned if the C/C++ type doesn't exist.

    .. versionadded:: 4.19

    This checks to see if an object implements the Python buffer protocol and,
    if so, optionally returns the buffer information.  It is similar to

        should be a corresponding call to :c:func:`sipReleaseBuffer`. 
    :return:
        > 0 if the object supports the buffer protocol and the buffer
        information was returned (if requested).  0 if the object does not
        support the buffer protocol.  < 0 (and a Python exception is raised) if
        the object supports the buffer protocol but there was an error
        returning the requested buffer information.

        C/C++ instance hasn't been wrapped.


.. c:function:: int sipGetState(PyObject *transferObj)

    The :directive:`%ConvertToTypeCode` directive requires that the provided
    code returns an ``int`` describing the state of the converted value.  The
    state usually depends on any transfers of ownership that have been
    requested.  This is a convenience function that returns the correct state
    when the converted value is a temporary.

    another module.

    :param name:
        the name of the symbol.
    :return:
        the value of the symbol.  ``NULL`` is returned if there is no such
        symbol.


.. c:function:: void sipInstanceDestroyed(sipSimpleWrapper *obj)

    .. versionadded:: 4.19.3

    This should be called by handwritten code if it is able to detect that a
    wrapped C++ instance has been destroyed from C++.  It should not be called

    method.  The structure elements are as follows.

    .. c:member:: PyObject *pm_function

        The function that implements the method.

    .. c:member:: PyObject *pm_self

        The bound object.

    .. c:member:: PyObject *pm_class

        The class.  (Python v2 only.)


.. c:function:: sipNewUserTypeFunc sipSetNewUserTypeHandler(const sipTypeDef *td, sipNewUserTypeFunc handler)

    .. versionadded:: 4.19

    The allows a function to be specified that is called whenever a user
    defined sub-class of a C/C++ type is created (i.e. one implemented in
    Python).  It is normalled called from a module's
    :directive:`%PostInitialisationCode`.  It is provided as an alternative to
    providing a meta-type when the limited Python API is enabled.

    :param td:
        the :ref:`generated type object <ref-type-objects>` corresponding to
        the C/C++ type.
    :param handler:
        the function that is called whenever a user defined sub-class of the
        type is created.  The function takes a single argument which is the
        :c:type:`sipWrapperType` of the user defined class.  It returns an
        :c:type:`int` which is 0 if there was no error.  A Python exception is
        raised and -1 returned if there was an error.
    :return:
        the previously installed handler.  This allows handlers to be chained.


.. c:function:: int sipParseResult(int *iserr, PyObject *method, PyObject *result, const char *format, ...)

    This converts a Python object (usually returned by a method) to C/C++ based
    on a format string and associated values in a similar way to the Python
    :c:func:`PyArg_ParseTuple()` function.

    :param iserr:
        if this is not ``NULL`` then the location it points to is set to a
        non-zero value if there was an error.
    :param method:
        the Python method that returned *result*.
    :param result:
        the Python object returned by *method*.
    :param format:
        the format string.
    :return:
        0 if there was no error.  Otherwise a negative value is returned, and
        an exception raised.

    This is normally called by handwritten code specified with the
    :directive:`%VirtualCatcherCode` directive with *method* being the supplied
    ``sipMethod`` and *result* being the value returned by
    :c:func:`sipCallMethod()`.

    If *format* begins and ends with parentheses then *result* must be a Python
    tuple and the rest of *format* is applied to the tuple contents.

    In the following description the first letter is the format character, the
    entry in parentheses is the Python object type that the format character
    will convert, and the entry in brackets are the types of the C/C++ values
    to be passed. 

    ``ae`` (object) [char \*]
        Convert a Python string-like object of length 1 to a C/C++ ``char``
        according to the encoding ``e``.  ``e`` can either be ``A`` for ASCII,
        ``L`` for Latin-1, or ``8`` for UTF-8.  For Python v2 the object may be
        either a string or a unicode object that can be encoded.  For Python v3
        the object may either be a bytes object or a string object that can be
        encoded.  An object that supports the buffer protocol may also be used.

    ``b`` (integer) [bool \*]
        Convert a Python integer to a C/C++ ``bool``.

    ``c`` (string/bytes) [char \*]
        Convert a Python v2 string object or a Python v3 bytes object of length
        1 to a C/C++ ``char``.

    ``d`` (float) [double \*]
        Convert a Python floating point number to a C/C++ ``double``.

    ``e`` (integer) [enum \*]
        Convert a Python integer to an anonymous C/C++ ``enum``.

    ``f`` (float) [float \*]
        Convert a Python floating point number to a C/C++ ``float``.

    ``g`` (string/bytes) [const char \*\*, :c:macro:`SIP_SSIZE_T` \*]
        Convert a Python v2 string object or a Python v3 bytes object to a
        C/C++ character array and its length.  If the Python object is
        ``Py_None`` then the array and length are ``NULL`` and zero
        respectively.

    ``h`` (integer) [short \*]
        Convert a Python integer to a C/C++ ``short``.

    ``i`` (integer) [int \*]
        Convert a Python integer to a C/C++ ``int``.

    ``l`` (long) [long \*]
        Convert a Python long to a C/C++ ``long``.

    ``m`` (long) [unsigned long \*]
        Convert a Python long to a C/C++ ``unsigned long``.

    ``n`` (long) [long long \*]
        Convert a Python long to a C/C++ ``long long``.

    ``o`` (long) [unsigned long long \*]
        Convert a Python long to a C/C++ ``unsigned long long``.

    ``s`` (string/bytes) [const char \*\*]
        .. deprecated:: 4.8
            Use ``B`` instead.

        Convert a Python v2 string object or a Python v3 bytes object to a
        C/C++ ``'\0'`` terminated string.  If the Python object is ``Py_None``
        then the string is ``NULL``.

    ``t`` (long) [unsigned short \*]
        Convert a Python long to a C/C++ ``unsigned short``.

    ``u`` (long) [unsigned int \*]
        Convert a Python long to a C/C++ ``unsigned int``.

    ``w`` (unicode/string) [wchar_t \*]
        Convert a Python v2 string or unicode object or a Python v3 string
        object of length 1 to a C/C++ wide character.

    ``x`` (unicode/string) [wchar_t \*\*]
        Convert a Python v2 string or unicode object or a Python v3 string
        object to a C/C++ ``L'\0'`` terminated wide character string.  If the
        Python object is ``Py_None`` then the string is ``NULL``.

    ``Ae`` (object) [int, const char \*\*]
        Convert a Python string-like object to a C/C++ ``'\0'`` terminated
        string according to the encoding ``e``.  ``e`` can either be ``A`` for
        ASCII, ``L`` for Latin-1, or ``8`` for UTF-8.  If the Python object is
        ``Py_None`` then the string is ``NULL``.  The integer uniquely
        identifies the object in the context defined by the ``S`` format
        character and allows an extra reference to the object to be kept to
        ensure that the string remains valid.  For Python v2 the object may be
        either a string or a unicode object that can be encoded.  For Python v3
        the object may either be a bytes object or a string object that can be
        encoded.  An object that supports the buffer protocol may also be used.

    ``B`` (string/bytes) [int, const char \*\*]
        Convert a Python v2 string object or a Python v3 bytes object to a
        C/C++ ``'\0'`` terminated string.  If the Python object is ``Py_None``
        then the string is ``NULL``.  The integer uniquely identifies the
        object in the context defined by the ``S`` format character and allows
        an extra reference to the object to be kept to ensure that the string
        remains valid.

    ``Cf`` (wrapped class) [:c:type:`sipWrapperType` \*, int \*, void \*\*]
        .. deprecated:: 4.8
            Use ``Hf`` instead.

        Convert a Python object to a C structure or a C++ class instance and
        return its state as described in :c:func:`sipConvertToInstance()`.
        ``f`` is a combination of the following flags encoded as an ASCII
        character by adding ``0`` to the combined value:

            0x01 disallows the conversion of ``Py_None`` to ``NULL``

            0x02 implements the :fanno:`Factory` and :fanno:`TransferBack`
                 annotations

            0x04 suppresses the return of the state of the returned C/C++
                 instance.  Note that the ``int *`` used to return the state is
                 not passed if this flag is specified.

    ``Df`` (wrapped instance) [const :c:type:`sipTypeDef` \*, int \*, void \*\*]
        .. deprecated:: 4.10.1
            Use ``Hf`` instead.

        Convert a Python object to a C structure, C++ class or mapped type
        instance and return its state as described in
        :c:func:`sipConvertToType()`.  ``f`` is a combination of the following
        flags encoded as an ASCII character by adding ``0`` to the combined
        value:

            0x01 disallows the conversion of ``Py_None`` to ``NULL``

            0x02 implements the :fanno:`Factory` and :fanno:`TransferBack`
                 annotations

            0x04 suppresses the return of the state of the returned C/C++
                 instance.  Note that the ``int *`` used to return the state is
                 not passed if this flag is specified.

    ``E`` (wrapped enum) [PyTypeObject \*, enum \*]
        .. deprecated:: 4.8
            Use ``F`` instead.

        Convert a Python named enum type to the corresponding C/C++ ``enum``.

    ``F`` (wrapped enum) [:c:type:`sipTypeDef` \*, enum \*]
        Convert a Python named enum type to the corresponding C/C++ ``enum``.

    ``G`` (unicode/string) [wchar_t \*\*, :c:macro:`SIP_SSIZE_T` \*]
        Convert a Python v2 string or unicode object or a Python v3 string
        object to a C/C++ wide character array and its length.  If the Python
        object is ``Py_None`` then the array and length are ``NULL`` and zero
        respectively.

    ``Hf`` (wrapped instance) [const :c:type:`sipTypeDef` \*, int \*, void \*\*]
        Convert a Python object to a C structure, C++ class or mapped type
        instance as described in :c:func:`sipConvertToType()`.  ``f`` is a
        combination of the following flags encoded as an ASCII character by
        adding ``0`` to the combined value:

            0x01 disallows the conversion of ``Py_None`` to ``NULL``

            0x02 implements the :fanno:`Factory` and :fanno:`TransferBack`
                 annotations

            0x04 returns a copy of the C/C++ instance.

    ``L`` (integer) [signed char \*]
        .. versionadded:: 4.12

        Convert a Python integer to a C/C++ ``signed char``.

    ``M`` (long) [unsigned char \*]
        .. versionadded:: 4.12

        Convert a Python long to a C/C++ ``unsigned char``.

    ``N`` (object) [PyTypeObject \*, PyObject \*\*]

        returned without any conversions.  The reference count is incremented.
        The Python object may be ``Py_None``.

    ``O`` (object) [PyObject \*\*]
        A Python object is returned without any conversions.  The reference
        count is incremented.

    ``S`` [:c:type:`sipSimpleWrapper` \*]
        This format character, if used, must be the first.  It is used with
        other format characters to define a context and doesn't itself convert
        an argument.

    ``T`` (object) [PyTypeObject \*, PyObject \*\*]
        A Python object is checked to see if it is a certain type and then
        returned without any conversions.  The reference count is incremented.
        The Python object may not be ``Py_None``.

    ``V`` (:class:`sip.voidptr`) [void \*\*]
        Convert a Python :class:`sip.voidptr` object to a C/C++ ``void *``.

    ``z`` (object) [const char \*, void \*\*]
        .. versionadded:: 4.14.1

        Convert a Python named capsule object to a C/C++ ``void *``.

    ``Z`` (object) []
        Check that a Python object is ``Py_None``.  No value is returned.

    ``!`` (object) [PyObject \*\*]
        .. versionadded:: 4.14.1

        A Python object is checked to see if it implements the buffer protocol
        and then returned without any conversions.  The reference count is
        incremented.  The Python object may not be ``Py_None``.

    ``$`` (object) [PyObject \*\*]
        .. versionadded:: 4.14.1

        A Python object is checked to see if it implements the buffer protocol
        and then returned without any conversions.  The reference count is
        incremented.  The Python object may be ``Py_None``.

    ``=`` (long) [size_t \*]
        .. versionadded:: 4.19.14

        Convert a Python long to a C/C++ ``size_t``.


.. c:function:: PyObject *sipPyTypeDict(const PyTypeObject *py_type)

    .. versionadded:: 4.19

    This provides access to a Python type object's ``tp_dict`` field and is
    typically used when the limited Python API is enabled.

    :param py_type:
        the type object.
    :return:
        the value of the type object's ``tp_dict`` field.


.. c:function:: const char *sipPyTypeName(const PyTypeObject *py_type)

    .. versionadded:: 4.19

    This provides access to a Python type object's ``tp_name`` field and is
    typically used when the limited Python API is enabled.

    :param py_type:
        the type object.
    :return:
        the value of the type object's ``tp_name`` field.


.. c:function:: int sipRegisterAttributeGetter(const sipTypeDef *td, sipAttrGetterFunc getter)

    This registers a getter that will called just before SIP needs to get an
    attribute from a wrapped type's dictionary for the first time.  The getter
    must then populate the type's dictionary with any lazy attributes.

    :param td:
        the optional :ref:`generated type structure <ref-type-structures>` that
        determines which types the getter will be called for.
    :param getter:
        the getter function.
    :return:
        0 if there was no error, otherwise -1 is returned.

    If *td* is not ``NULL`` then the getter will only be called for types with
    that type or that are sub-classed from it.  Otherwise the getter will be
    called for all types.

    A getter has the following signature.

    int getter(const :c:type:`sipTypeDef` \*td, PyObject \*dict)

        *td* is the generated type definition of the type whose dictionary is
        to be populated.

        *dict* is the dictionary to be populated.

        0 is returned if there was no error, otherwise -1 is returned.

    See the section :ref:`ref-lazy-type-attributes` for more details.


.. c:function:: int sipRegisterExitNotifier(PyMethodDef *md)

    .. versionadded:: 4.19.19

    This registers a C function with Python's :py:mod:`atexit` module that will
    be called when the interpreter terminates.

    :param md:
        the data structure that describes the C function to be called.
    :return:
        0 if there was no error, otherwise -1 is returned.


.. c:function:: int sipRegisterProxyResolver(const sipTypeDef *td, sipProxyResolverFunc resolver)

    .. versionadded:: 4.15

    This registers a resolver that will called just before SIP wraps a C/C++
    pointer in a Python object.  The resolver may choose to replace the C/C++
    pointer with the address of another object.  Typically this is used to
    replace a proxy by the object that is being proxied for.

    :param td:
        the optional :ref:`generated type structure <ref-type-structures>` that
        determines which type the resolver will be called for.
    :param resolver:
        the resolver function.
    :return:
        0 if there was no error, otherwise -1 is returned.

    A resolver has the following signature.

    void \*resolver(void \*proxy)

        *proxy* is C/C++ pointer that is being wrapped.

        The C/C++ pointer that will actually be wrapped is returned.


.. c:function:: int sipRegisterPyType(PyTypeObject *type)

    This registers a Python type object that can be used as the meta-type or
    super-type of a wrapped C++ type.
    
    :param type:
        the type object.
    :return:
        0 if there was no error, otherwise -1 is returned.

    See the section :ref:`ref-types-metatypes` for more details.


.. c:function:: void sipReleaseBufferInfo(sipBufferInfoDef *buffer_info)

    .. versionadded:: 4.19

    This releases the buffer information related to a Python object that
    implements the buffer protocol that was created with a corresponding call
    to :c:func:`sipGetBufferInfo`.  It is similar to
    :c:func:`PyBuffer_Release` and should be used instead of that when the
    limited Python API is enabled.

    :param buffer_info:
        the buffer information to release.


.. c:function:: void sipReleaseInstance(void *cpp, sipWrapperType *type, int state)

    .. deprecated:: 4.8
        Use :c:func:`sipReleaseType()` instead.

    This destroys a wrapped C/C++ instance if it was a temporary instance.  It
    is called after a call to either :c:func:`sipConvertToInstance()` or
    :c:func:`sipForceConvertToInstance()`.
    
    :param cpp:
        the C/C++ instance.
    :param type:
        the type's :ref:`generated type object <ref-type-objects>`.

.. c:function:: void sipReleaseMappedType(void *cpp, const sipMappedType *mt, int state)

    .. deprecated:: 4.8
        Use :c:func:`sipReleaseType()` instead.

    This destroys a wrapped C/C++ mapped type if it was a temporary instance.
    It is called after a call to either :c:func:`sipConvertToMappedType()` or
    :c:func:`sipForceConvertToMappedType()`.
    
    :param cpp:
        the C/C++ instance.
    :param mt:
        the opaque structure returned by :c:func:`sipFindMappedType()`.
    :param state:
        describes the state of the C/C++ instance.


.. c:function:: void sipReleaseType(void *cpp, const sipTypeDef *td, int state)

    This destroys a wrapped C/C++ or mapped type instance if it was a temporary
    instance.  It is called after a call to either :c:func:`sipConvertToType()`
    or :c:func:`sipForceConvertToType()`.
    
    :param cpp:
        the C/C++ instance.
    :param td:
        the type's :ref:`generated type structure <ref-type-structures>`.
    :param state:
        describes the state of the C/C++ instance.


.. c:function:: const char *sipResolveTypedef(const char *name)

    This returns the value of a C/C++ typedef.

    :param name:
        the name of the typedef.
    :return:
        the value of the typedef or ``NULL`` if there was no such typedef.


.. c:function:: void sipSetDestroyOnExit(int destroy)

    .. versionadded:: 4.14.7

    When the Python interpreter exits it garbage collects those objects that it
    can.  This means that any corresponding C++ instances and C structures
    owned by Python are destroyed.  Unfortunately this happens in an
    unpredictable order and so can cause memory faults within the wrapped
    library.  Calling this function with a value of zero disables the automatic
    destruction of C++ instances and C structures.

    :param destroy:
        non-zero if all C++ instances and C structures owned by Python should
        be destroyed when the interpreter exits.  This is the default.


.. c:function:: void sipSetTypeUserData(sipWrapperType *type, void *data)

    .. versionadded:: 4.19

    Each generated type corresponding to a wrapped C/C++ type, or a user
    sub-class of such a type, contains a pointer for the use of handwritten
    code.  This sets the value of that pointer.

    :param type:
        the type object.
    :param data:
        the type-specific pointer.


.. c:function:: void sipSetUserObject(sipSimpleWrapper *obj, PyObject *user)

    .. versionadded:: 4.19

    Each wrapped object can contain a reference to a single Python object that
    can be used for any purpose by handwritten code and will automatically be
    garbage collected at the appropriate time.  This sets that object.

    :param obj:
        the wrapped object.
    :param user:
        a borrowed reference to the user object.


.. c:type:: sipSimpleWrapper

    This is a C structure that represents a Python wrapped instance whose type
    is :class:`sip.simplewrapper`.  It is an extension of the ``PyObject``
    structure and so may be safely cast to it.

    When the limited Python API is enabled and Python v3.2 or later is being
    used then it is only available as an opaque (i.e. incomplete) type and the
    following members are not available.

    .. c:member:: void *data

        This is initialised to the address of the C/C++ instance.  If an access
        function is subsequently provided then it may be used for any purpose
        by the access function.

    .. c:member:: sipAccessFunc access_func

        This is the address of an optional access function that is called, with
        a pointer to this structure as its first argument.  If its second
        argument is ``UnguardedPointer`` then it returns the address of the
        C/C++ instance, even if it is known that its value is no longer valid.
        If the second argument is ``GuardedPointer`` then it returns the
        address of the C++ instance or ``0`` if it is known to be invalid.  If
        the second argument is ``ReleaseGuard`` then the structure is being
        deallocated and any dynamic resources used by the access function
        should be released.  If there is no access function then the
        :c:member:`sipSimpleWrapper.data` is used as the address of the C/C++
        instance.  Typically a custom meta-type is used to set an access method
        after the Python object has been created.

    .. c:member:: PyObject *user

        This can be used for any purpose by handwritten code and will
        automatically be garbage collected at the appropriate time.


.. c:var:: PyTypeObject *sipSimpleWrapper_Type

    This is the type of a :c:type:`sipSimpleWrapper` structure and is the C
    implementation of :class:`sip.simplewrapper`.  It may be safely cast to
    :c:type:`sipWrapperType`.

    When the limited Python API is enabled and Python v3.2 or later is being
    used then it is only available as an opaque (i.e. incomplete) type.


.. c:type:: sipStringTypeClassMap

    .. deprecated:: 4.8

    This C structure is used with :c:func:`sipMapStringToClass()` to define a
    mapping between ``'\0'`` terminated string based RTTI and
    :ref:`ref-type-objects`.  The structure elements are as follows.

    .. c:member:: char *typeString

        The ``'\0'`` terminated string RTTI.

    .. c:member:: sipWrapperType **pyType.

        A pointer to the corresponding generated type object.


.. c:type:: sipTimeDef

    .. versionadded:: 4.19

    This C structure is used with :c:func:`sipGetTime()`,
    :c:func:`sipFromTime()`, :c:func:`sipGetDateTime()` and
    :c:func:`sipFromDateTime()` and encapsulates the components parts of a
    Python time.  The structure elements are as follows.

    .. c:member:: int pt_hour

        The hour (0-23).

    .. c:member:: int pt_minute

        The minute (0-59).

    .. c:member:: int pt_second

        The second (0-59).

    .. c:member:: int pt_microsecond

        The microsecond (0-999999).


.. c:function:: void sipTransferBack(PyObject *obj)

    This transfers ownership of a Python wrapped instance to Python (see
    :ref:`ref-object-ownership`).

    :param obj:
        the wrapped instance.
        
    In addition, any association of the instance with regard to the cyclic
    garbage collector with another instance is removed.


.. c:function:: void sipTransferBreak(PyObject *obj)

    Any association of a Python wrapped instance with regard to the cyclic
    garbage collector with another instance is removed.  Ownership of the
    instance should be with C++.

    :param obj:
        the wrapped instance.

    .. deprecated:: 4.14
        Use the following instead:

            sipTransferTo(obj, NULL);


.. c:function:: void sipTransferTo(PyObject *obj, PyObject *owner)

    This transfers ownership of a Python wrapped instance to C++ (see
    :ref:`ref-object-ownership`).

    :param obj:
        the wrapped instance.
    :param owner:
        an optional wrapped instance that *obj* becomes associated with with
        regard to the cyclic garbage collector.  If *owner* is ``NULL`` then no
        such association is made.  If *owner* is ``Py_None`` then *obj* is
        given an extra reference which is removed when the C++ instance's
        destructor is called.  If *owner* is the same value as *obj* then any
        reference cycles involving *obj* can never be detected or broken by the
        cyclic garbage collector.  Responsibility for calling the C++
        instance's destructor is always transfered to C++.


.. c:function:: PyTypeObject *sipTypeAsPyTypeObject(const sipTypeDef *td)

    This returns a pointer to the Python type object that SIP creates for a
    :ref:`generated type structure <ref-type-structures>`.

    :param td:
        the type structure.
    :return:
        the Python type object.  If the type structure refers to a mapped type
        then ``NULL`` will be returned.

    If the type structure refers to a C structure or C++ class then the
    Python type object may be safely cast to a :c:type:`sipWrapperType`.


.. c:function:: const sipTypeDef *sipTypeFromPyTypeObject(PyTypeObject *py_type)

    This returns the :ref:`generated type structure <ref-type-structures>` for
    a Python type object.

    :param py_type:

        the type structure.
    :return:
        a non-zero value if the type structure refers to a C-style named enum.


.. c:function:: int sipTypeIsMapped(sipTypeDef *td)

    This checks if a :ref:`generated type structure <ref-type-structures>`
    refers to a mapped type.

    :param td:
        the type structure.
    :return:
        a non-zero value if the type structure refers to a mapped type.


.. c:function:: int sipTypeIsNamespace(sipTypeDef *td)

    This checks if a :ref:`generated type structure <ref-type-structures>`
    refers to a C++ namespace.

    :param td:
        the type structure.

        a non-zero value if the type structure refers to a namespace.


.. c:function:: int sipTypeIsScopedEnum(sipTypeDef *td)

    .. versionadded:: 4.19.4

    This checks if a :ref:`generated type structure <ref-type-structures>`
    refers to a C++11 scoped enum.

    :param td:
        the type structure.
    :return:
        a non-zero value if the type structure refers to a C++11 scoped enum.


.. c:function:: const char *sipTypeName(const sipTypeDef *td)

    This returns the C/C++ name of a wrapped type.

    :param td:
        the type's :ref:`generated type structure <ref-type-structures>`.

        the character (not byte) index of the character to be updated.
    :param value:
        the value of the new character.


.. c:function:: void sipVisitWrappers(sipWrapperVisitorFunc visitor, void *closure)

    .. versionadded:: 4.19.19

    This calls a visitor function for every wrapper object.

    :param visitor:
        the visitor function.
    :param closure:
        a pointer that is passed to the visitor.

    A visitor has the following signature.

    void visitor(sipSimpleWrapper \*obj, void \*closure)

        *obj* is the wrapped object being visited.

        *closure* is the pointer passed to :c:func:`sipVisitWrappers()`.


.. c:var:: PyTypeObject *sipVoidPtr_Type

    This is the type of a ``PyObject`` structure that is used to wrap a
    ``void *``.


.. c:type:: sipWrapper

    This is a C structure that represents a Python wrapped instance whose type
    is :class:`sip.wrapper`.  It is an extension of the
    :c:type:`sipSimpleWrapper` and ``PyObject`` structures and so may be safely
    cast to both.

    When the limited Python API is enabled and Python v3.2 or later is being
    used then it is only available as an opaque (i.e. incomplete) type.


.. c:function:: int sipWrapper_Check(PyObject *obj)

    .. deprecated:: 4.8
        Use the following instead:

            PyObject_TypeCheck(obj, sipWrapper_Type)

    This checks if a Python object is a wrapped instance.

    :param obj:
        the Python object.
    :return:
        a non-zero value if the Python object is a wrapped instance.


.. c:var:: PyTypeObject *sipWrapper_Type

    This is the type of a :c:type:`sipWrapper` structure and is the C
    implementation of :class:`sip.wrapper`.  It may be safely cast to
    :c:type:`sipWrapperType`.


.. c:type:: sipWrapperType

    This is a C structure that represents a SIP generated type object.  It is
    an extension of the ``PyTypeObject`` structure (which is itself an
    extension of the ``PyObject`` structure) and so may be safely cast to
    ``PyTypeObject`` (and ``PyObject``).

    When the limited Python API is enabled and Python v3.2 or later is being
    used then it is only available as an opaque (i.e. incomplete) type.


.. c:var:: PyTypeObject *sipWrapperType_Type

    This is the type of a :c:type:`sipWrapperType` structure and is the C
    implementation of :class:`sip.wrappertype`.


Event Handlers
--------------

.. versionadded:: 4.19.3

The :mod:`sip` module will trigger a number of events.  Handwritten code can
supply handlers for these events to allow it to perform additional actions.
Each event has a type, described by the :cpp:enum:`sipEventType` enum.  An
event handler is registered using :c:func:`sipRegisterEventHandler()`.  The
signature of an event handler is specific to the event type.


.. cpp:enum:: sipEventType

    This is the enum that defines the different event types.


.. :cpp:enumerator:: sipEventWrappedInstance

    This event is triggered whenever a C/C++ instance that is created by C/C++
    (and not by Python) is wrapped.  The handler is passed a ``void *`` which
    is the address of the C/C++ instance.


.. :cpp:enumerator:: sipEventCollectingWrapper

    This event is triggered whenever a Python wrapper object is being garbage
    collected.  The handler is passed a pointer to the
    :c:type:`sipSimpleWrapper` object that is the Python wrapper object being
    garbage collected.


.. c:function:: int sipRegisterEventHandler(sipEventType type, const sipTypeDef *td, void *handler)

    This registers an event handler which will be called whenever an event is
    triggered.

    :param type:
        the event type for which the handler is registered.
    :param td:
        the generated type structure - the handler will only be invoked for
        Python object corresponding to this type or a sub-type.
    :param handler:
        the handler that is called when the event is triggered.
    :return:
        0 if there was no error, otherwise -1 is returned (and a Python
        exception is raised).


.. _ref-type-structures:

Generated Type Structures
-------------------------

SIP generates an opaque type structure for each C structure, C++ class, C++
namespace, named enum or mapped type being wrapped.  These are
:c:type:`sipTypeDef` structures and are used extensively by the SIP API.

The names of these structure are prefixed by ``sipType_``.

For those structures that correspond to C structures, C++ classes, C++
namespaces or named enums the remaining part of the name is the fully
qualified name of the structure, class, namespace or enum name.  Any ``::``
scope separators are replaced by an underscore.  For example, the type object
for class ``Klass`` is ``sipType_Klass``.

For those structure that correspond to mapped types the remaining part of the
name is generated by SIP.  The only way for handwritten code to obtain a
pointer to a structure for a mapped type is to use :c:func:`sipFindType()`.

The type structures of all imported types explicitly used by a module are
available to handwritten code.


.. _ref-type-objects:

Generated Type Objects
----------------------

.. deprecated:: 4.8
    Use the corresponding generated type structure (see
    :ref:`ref-type-structures`) and :c:func:`sipTypeAsPyTypeObject()` instead.

SIP generates a :c:type:`sipWrapperType` type object for each C structure or
C++ class being wrapped.

These objects are named with the structure or class name prefixed by
``sipClass_``.  For example, the type object for class ``Klass`` is
``sipClass_Klass``.


.. _ref-enum-type-objects:

Generated Named Enum Type Objects
---------------------------------

.. deprecated:: 4.8
    Use the corresponding generated type structure (see
    :ref:`ref-type-structures`) and :c:func:`sipTypeAsPyTypeObject()` instead.

SIP generates a type object for each named enum being wrapped.  These are
PyTypeObject structures.  (Anonymous enums are wrapped as Python integers.)

These objects are named with the fully qualified enum name (i.e. including any
enclosing scope) prefixed by ``sipEnum_``.  For example, the type object for
enum ``Enum`` defined in class ``Klass`` is ``sipEnum_Klass_Enum``.


.. _ref-derived-classes:

Generated Derived Classes
-------------------------

For most C++ classes being wrapped SIP generates a derived class with the same
name prefixed by ``sip``.  For example, the derived class for class ``Klass``
is ``sipKlass``.

If a C++ class doesn't have any virtual or protected methods in it or any of
it's super-class hierarchy, or does not emit any Qt signals, then a derived
class is not generated.

Most of the time handwritten code should ignore the derived classes.  The only
exception is that handwritten constructor code specified using the
:directive:`%MethodCode` directive should call the derived class's constructor
(which has the same C++ signature) rather then the wrapped class's constructor.


.. _ref-exception-objects:

Generated Exception Objects
---------------------------

SIP generates a Python object for each exception defined with the
:directive:`%Exception` directive.

These objects are named with the fully qualified exception name (i.e. including
any enclosing scope) prefixed by ``sipException_``.  For example, the type
object for enum ``Except`` defined in class ``Klass`` is
``sipException_Klass_Except``.

The objects of all imported exceptions are available to handwritten code.
