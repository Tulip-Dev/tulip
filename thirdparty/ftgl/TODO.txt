FTGL 2.04
12 April 2003

TODO:
    
    
FUTURE:
    - select face ie italic, bold etc
    - Multiple sizes
    - Optimise performance and mem usage.
    - Use the Freetype Cache mechanism. FTC_xxx
    - Handle non western scripts.
    - Multiple Masters
    - String Cache or string chunks
    - Provide an interface to access the point data for outlines and
      polygon meshes. Part way there with new vectoriser.
    - Have a look at improving the algorthm for making curves. Maybe a
      distance metric might be the way to go so that rather than having
      5 polylines (0.2 step) for every curve, adjust the fineness for
      the length of the curve. But then you should also test the angle
      of the tangents as well.
      Jed's new bezier stuff.
    - Template methods
    - Move the init code out of the glyph constructors into an init
      function so that they can return errors.
      

BUGS:
    - FTExtrdGlyph - Some glyph contours are 'wound' in reverse causing
      the 'sides' of the extrusions to be culled. First fix only half
      worked. When calculating the winding using the summed area I need
      to use the outside contour only. How do I know it's an outside
      contour? A workaround is to disable face culling.
    - FTGLTextureFonts can't be used inside display lists. This because the
      glGet call to check the current texture id can't be used in a display
      list. It is only a valid call when the list is compiled and is ignore after
      that.
    - The texture co-ords in the Texture Font may be wrong for non
      scalable fonts.
