//! Planar graph embedding that minimizes block-nesting depth and maximizes the external face
//! and optimizes the position of blocks afterwards.
/**
 * @ingroup ga-planembed
 *
 * After computing an embedding just as ogdf::EmbedderMinDepthMaxFace does,
 * blocks are placed in faces that are closest to the external one.
 *
 * See the paper "Graph Embedding with Minimum Depth and Maximum External Face"
 * by C. Gutwenger and P. Mutzel (2004)
 * and diploma thesis  "Algorithmen zur Bestimmung von guten Graph-Einbettungen f√ºr orthogonale Zeichnungen" (in German)
 * by Thorsten Kerkhof (2007) for details.
