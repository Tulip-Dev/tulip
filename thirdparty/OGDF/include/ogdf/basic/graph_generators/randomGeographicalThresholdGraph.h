 * Distribute vertices using an exponential distribution in a d-dimensional Euclidean space.
 * Then a pair of vertices with weights \a w,\a w' and Euclidean distance \f$r:=||w-w'||\f$ are connected iff
 * for the heuristic function \p h holds:
 *  \f$(w+w')*h(r) < \mathrm{threshold}\f$.
 *
 * @tparam D the random distribution to use (see \p dist).
 * @param G is assigned the generated graph.
 * @param weights has the weights for all nodes in the graph.
 * @param dist is a random number distribution, e.g. \c std::uniform_int_distribution<>.
 *             It should likely generate values in roughly the same order of magnitude as \p h(\p threshold).
 * @param threshold is the threshold for edge insertion.
 * @param h is a function that should be decreasing in the distance supplied to it.
 * @param dimension is the dimension the nodes are laid out in.
