/**
 * Dynamic BC-trees.
 *
 * @ingroup decomp
 *
 * This class provides dynamic BC-trees.\n
 * The main difference of the dynamic BC-tree structure compared to the static
 * one implemented by the class BCTree is, that B- and C-components are not any
 * longer represented by single vertices of a BC-tree graph structure but by
 * root vertices of UNION/FIND-trees. This allows path condensation within the
 * BC-tree, when edges are inserted into the original graph. Path condensation
 * is done by gathering BC-tree-vertices into a UNION/FIND-tree. However, the
 * original vertices of the BC-tree remain in the \a m_B graph, but only those
 * being the roots of their respective UNION/FIND-tree are proper representants
 * of the biconnected components of the original graph.
