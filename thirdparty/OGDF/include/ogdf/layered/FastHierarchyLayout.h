/**
 * \brief Coordinate assignment phase for the Sugiyama algorithm by Buchheim et al.
 *
 * @ingroup gd-hlm
 *
 * This class implements a hierarchy layout algorithm, i.e., it layouts
 * hierarchies with a given order of nodes on each layer. It is used as a third
 * phase of the Sugiyama algorithm.
 *
 * All edges of the layout will have at most two bends. Additionally,
 * for each edge having exactly two bends, the segment between them is
 * drawn vertically. This applies in particular to the long edges
 * arising in the first phase of the Sugiyama algorithm.
 *
 * The implementation is based on:
 *
 * Christoph Buchheim, Michael JÃ¼nger, Sebastian Leipert: <i>A Fast %Layout
 * Algorithm for k-Level Graphs</i>. LNCS 1984 (Proc. %Graph Drawing 2000),
 * pp. 229-240, 2001.
 *
