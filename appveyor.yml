# Tulip continuous integration on windows platform through AppVeyor.
# Tulip will be compiled 64 bits windows using :
#   - GCC compiler provided by the MSYS2 project
#   - Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 compiler
# C++11 standard, Qt 5.5 and Python 3.9 will be used to build Tulip with both compilers.

# use Visual Studio 2019 appveyor image for the builds
os: Visual Studio 2019

# Use build caches that will be saved and restored between build jobs.
# Those caches will hold ccache content for gcc builds and clcache content for msvc builds
# in order to speedup incremental builds.
# Appveyor cache storage is limited to 1GB, so cache should be cleared once it is exceeding this quota
# (see https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-cache/)
cache:
  - C:\msys64\home\appveyor\.ccache
  - C:\Users\appveyor\clcache
