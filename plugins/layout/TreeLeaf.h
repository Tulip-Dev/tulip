/**
 * \file
 * \brief An implementation of a simple tree layout.
 *
 * This plugin is an implementation of a simple tree layout.
 * All leaves are placed at a distance one (x-coordinates) and the order
 * is the one of a suffix ordering. The y coordinates is the depth in the
 * tree. The other nodes are placed at the center of their children
 * (x-coordinates), and the y-coordinate is their depth in the tree.
 *
 * \note Let n be the number of nodes, the algorithm complexity is in O(n).
