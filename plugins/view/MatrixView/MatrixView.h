/** \file
 *  \brief Adjacency matrix view
 * In mathematics and computer science, an adjacency matrix is a means of representing which
 * vertices of a graph are adjacent to which other vertices. Another matrix representation for a
 * graph is the incidence matrix.
 *
 * Specifically, the adjacency matrix of a finite graph G on n vertices is the n  n matrix where the
 * non-diagonal entry aij is the number of edges from vertex i to vertex j, and the diagonal entry
 * aii, depending on the convention, is either once or twice the number of edges (loops) from vertex
 * i to itself.
 * Undirected graphs often use the former convention of counting loops twice, whereas directed
 * graphs typically use the latter convention.
 * There exists a unique adjacency matrix for each isomorphism class of graphs (up to permuting rows
 * and columns), and it is not the adjacency matrix of any other isomorphism class of graphs. In the
 * special case of a finite simple graph, the adjacency matrix is a (0,1)-matrix with zeros on its
 * diagonal.
 * If the graph is undirected, the adjacency matrix is symmetric.
