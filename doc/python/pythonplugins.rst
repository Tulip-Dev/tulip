Writing Tulip plugins in Python
===============================

The Tulip Python bindings offer the possibility to write Tulip plugins in pure Python.
You can easily develop and test Python plugins from the Tulip GUI through the "Plugins editor" tab
of the Tulip plugins editor accessible through de *Python* button (see :ref:`Using the bindings from the Tulip Software GUI <usingBindingsInTulipGUI>`).

Below is the list of plugins that can be implemented in Python :

	* General algorithms
	* Selection algorithms
	* Color algorithms
	* Measure algorithms
	* Integer algorithms
	* Layout algorithms
	* Size algorithms
	* Export modules
	* Import modules
	
Developing a plugin consists in writing a Python module (in a specific .py file) that contains the implementation 
of a Python class deriving from another one specific to the plugin type.
The plugin is then registered in the plugin database through the use of 
specific functions from the :mod:`tuliplugins` module (see :ref:`tulipplugins module API <tulippluginsref>`).
Once the plugin written and functional, you can copy the source file(s) to the following directory :
<tulip_install_dir>/lib/tulip/python and it will be automatically loaded at Tulip startup.
The remaining of this section illustrates how to write each type of plugin.

Writing a general algorithm in Python
--------------------------------------

A general algorithm must implement the :class:`tlp.Algorithm` interface as illustrated below::

  from tulip import tlp
  import tulipplugins

  class GeneralAlgorithmExample(tlp.Algorithm):
    def __init__(self, context):
      tlp.Algorithm.__init__(self, context)
      # you can add parameters to the plugin here through the following syntax
      # self.add<Type>Parameter("<paramName>", "<paramDoc>", "<paramDefaultValue>")
      # (see documentation of class tlp.WithParameter to see what types of parameters are supported)

    def check(self):
      # This method is called before applying the algorithm on the input graph.
      # You can perform some precondition checks here.
      # See comments in the run method to know how to access to the input graph.

      # Must return a tuple (boolean, string). First member indicates if the algorithm can be applied
      # and the second one can be used to provide an error message
      return (True, "Ok")

    def run(self):
      # This method is the entry point of the algorithm when it is called
      # and must contain its implementation.

      # The graph on which the algorithm is applied can be accessed through
      # the "graph" class attribute (see documentation of class tlp.Graph).

      # The parameters provided by the user are stored in a dictionary
      # that can be accessed through the "dataSet" class attribute.

      # The method must return a boolean indicating if the algorithm
      # has been successfully applied on the input graph.
      return True

  # The line below does the magic to register the plugin to the plugin database
  # and updates the GUI to make it accessible through the menus.
