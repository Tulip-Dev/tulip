/*
 * Note for developers
 *
 * When writing the doxygen documentation for a class, one should follow those steps:
 *
 * 1/ Remove the @cond DOXYGEN_HIDDEN condition on top of the header and the @endcond tag at the bottom.
 *   If you are adding a new class to Tulip and didn't write the documentation yet, you should add those tags until the documentation is written.
 * 2/ Every class should belong to a doxygen group. This means that a @ingroup declaration must be added before the class @brief tag.
 * 3/ A doxygen group is identified by a single-word identifier (first word after the @defgroup declaration). What follows in the  @defgroup declaration is the pretty name that will appear into the final HTML document.
 * 3/ Definitions for doxygen groups are found in this file.
 * 4/ Code examples and tutorials belong in this directory too. There should be one header per tutorial to ease documentation process.
 * 5/ Please remember that code comments should NEVER begin with /** (use /* instead) in order to exclude them from doxygen.
