This directory contains bundlers for Tulip releases vor various target plateforms.

When writing a new bundler, you should stick to the following rules:

 . Write a system-native bash script or executable.
 . Your executable should take two parameters: The first one is the directory where binaries have been installed by CMake, the second one is the directory where the resulting installer should be put.

As a consequence, running a bundler should be achieved by respecting those steps:

 . Run CMake and compile tulip
 . Run a make install
 . Run the bundler_script <CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX> <dest_dir>

Note: bundler scripts should always be called from within their containing directories.
