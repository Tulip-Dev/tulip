/**
  @ingroup Plugins

  @brief View plugins provide a way to dynamically add to a Tulip plateform various ways to
  visualize a graph.

  A view takes the following elements as inputs:
  @li A graph which contains the data to be displayed.
  @li A state (@c tlp::DataSet) which contains initialization parameters.

  As an output, a View must provide a @c QGraphicsView instance where all drawing is done.
  User interaction on a View is handled by the tlp::Interactor class. Several interactors can be
  installed on the same view but there can be only one active interactor at the same time.
  In the end, the view can provide several configuration widgets used to set up additional
  parameters.

  When a View gets created, the following methods will always be called in the following order:
  @li The constructor. Basically, you don't want to do anything in this method as View instance may
  be created at Tulip startup when the plugin system gets initialized. Subsequent methods will be
  called in order for the view to build UI elements
  @li View::setupUi(). Notifies the view it can now build GUI components since every part of its
  initial state should be valid by now. Once this method is called, any call to View::graphicsView()
  is expected to return a valid pointer object.
  @li View::setGraph. Sets the graph that is meant to be visualized in the View's panel.
  @li View::setState(). Sets initial data. This method may be used to restore a previously backed-up
  state retrieved from the View::state() method.
  @li View::interactorsInstalled(). Notifies the view of the available interactors. Interactors
  objects taken from the list have already been initialized.

  Once the View is initialized, none of the previously mentioned methods, except View::setGraph(),
  can be called again.
  View::setGraph method may be called again to notify the view that another graph should be
  displayed (this may be a sub/parent graph of the previously displayed graph or a graph coming from
  a totally different hierarchy)

  Views are meant to be managed by an overleying system. As a consequence, a view may not decide
  directly when to redraw.
  Thus, you should never call the View::draw() method. To notify the overleying system that your
  view needs to be redrawn, emit the View::drawNeeded() signal instead.

  A tlp::View subclass automatically inherits from the tlp::Observable interface. The tlp::View
  interface also automatically listn to its active graph to trigger handling trigger when this graph
  gets deleted.
  When the graph associated to a View gets deleted, the View::graphDeleted() callback is triggered.
  @see graphDeleted() for more information.
