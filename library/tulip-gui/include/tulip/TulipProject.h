  @brief The TulipProject object handles the content of a Tulip project.

  All tulip projects contain a set of defined static meta-information:
  @list
  @li name (QString): the name of the project
  @li description (QString): Comments about the project
  @li author (QString): the author of the project
  @li perspective (QString): the name of the perspective plugin associated to
  the project
  @li date (QDate): the date of project's last modification
  @li version (QString): the version of the Tulip project format
  @endlist

  Alongside this information, one can store any kind of file into a Tulip
  project. Since a project is meant to be associated to a specific perspective,
  the responisbility of those file is left to the perspective.

  A TulipProject DOES NOT automatically save to disk. One will have to call the
  write() method to serialize data.
  @warning Precise implementation of the TulipProject object should NOT be known
  or used by the user since it could be subject to changes.

  If something wrong happens when calling a method from TulipProject, this
  method will return either false or a invalid result (see specific method
  documentation). The last error message can be retrieved with the lastError()
  method.

  After opening and before saving a project, user will be able to list/delete
  files and directories available in the project and open them using std
  filestreams or Qt's QIODevice. Files can be opened using the stdFileStram and
  fileStream methods. They will always be opened in Read/Write mode.

  Files in a tulip project are identified by their path. Those path ar similar
  to the path of a standard file system and use the "/" character as a
  separator. The root directory is identified by "/".

  @warning TulipProject path ALWAYS use the "/" character as a directory
  separator. This is OS-independant.

  @note A file called graph.tlp located at the top-level directory will be
  identified by the
  "/graph.tlp" path while the file "graph.tlp" located in the "data" directory
  will be identified by
  "/data/graph.tlp".
