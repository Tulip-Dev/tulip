/**
  @ingroup Plugins

  @brief ViewWidget provides convenience functions to allow the user to build a
  view plugin that displays a QWidget as its main element.

  The ViewWidget class will build a QGraphicsView that sets a widget as the
  background of the whole panel. Sublassing ViewWidget means that you'll have to
  provide a centralWidget (see ViewWidget::setCentralWidget) that will take up
  the whole panel and be drawn in the background. You can use the addToScene()
  and removeFromScene() methods to edit the QGraphicsItems that will drawn over
  the widget.

  By default, when an interactor gets active on a ViewWidget, it gets installed
  on the centralWidget (see Interactor::install)

  @note When creating a ViewWidget, you should overload setupWidget instead of
  setupUi. If you still want to implement setupUi, you must call the
  ViewWidget::setupUi() method first.
