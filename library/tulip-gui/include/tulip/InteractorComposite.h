  @class InteractorComposite is a subclass of Interactor that allows building Interactors using
  component classes focused specifically on input handling.

  The composite behaves like a regular interactor. Event handling is made using InteractorComponent
  subclasses.
  Basically, an InteractorComposite is a list of InteractorComponent. Each of them are meant to be
  pushed in the list using the push_back and push_front methods.
  When an event is caught by the InteractorComposite, it will iterate over all components (in th
  order provided by the list) and run eventFilter on each one of them until one of the component
  returns true.

  When subclassing InteractorComposite, you should push your components in the construct() method
  (take care of the order they are pushed in).
  Once the setView() method is called (after construct()), the init() method will be run on every
  components.
