/**
 * @ingroup Graph
 * The class Graph is the interface of a Graph in the Tulip Library.
 *
 * There are a few principles to know when working with a Tulip Graph.
 *
 * @chapter Directed
 * Every edge is directed in a Tulip Graph.
 * You can choose to ignore this, but every edge has a source and destination.
 *
 * @chapter Inheritance
 *
 * Subgraphs inherit from their parent graph.
 * This is true of nodes and edges; every node and edge in a subgraph also exists in each of its parent graphs.
 * This is also true of properties; every property in a graph exist in all of its subgraphs, except if it has been replaced
 * by a local property.
 *
 * For instance, if you have the following graph hierarchy:
 * root
 *  / \
 * A   B
 *
 * Every node in A is in root, and every node in B is in root.
 * Nodes can be in A and root but not B; or in B and root but not A.
 *
 * For instance, imagine a graph. You want to compare it to its Delaunay triangulation.
 * You need to create a subgraph that is a clone of the original (say this is A) to keep the original graph,
 * and another copy (say this one is B) on which you will perform the delaunay triangulation.
 *
 * B will have none of the original edges, and A will have only the original edges.
 *
 * As for properties; let's imagine the same graph hierarchy.
 * You want to compare two different layouts on the same graph.
 * You need to create two clone subgraphs, on each you make the 'viewLayout' property local.
 * This results in A and B having different values for the layout, but everything else in common.
 * You then can apply two different algorithms on A and B (e.g. Bubble Tree and Tree Radial).
 *
 * @chapter Meta Nodes
 * A meta node is a node representing a subgraph of the current graph.
 *
 * @chapter Undo Redo
 * The Tulip Graph object supports for undo and redo of modifications.
 *The operations affect the whole graph hierarchy, and cannot be limited to a subgraph.
 *
