  void reverse(const tlp::Graph* graph = NULL);
%Docstring
tlp.BooleanProperty.reverse(graph = None)

Reverses all values associated to graph elements,
i.e :const:`True` => :const:`False`, :const:`False` => :const:`True`.

:param graph: a subgraph can be given in parameter, in that case reverse
  only values of elements belonging to that subgraph
:type graph: :class:`tlp.Graph`
%End

  void reverseEdgeDirection(tlp::Graph* graph = NULL);
%Docstring
tlp.BooleanProperty.reverseEdgeDirection(graph = None)

Reverses all the direction of edges in the attached graph
which are set to :const:`True` in this boolean property.

:param graph: a subgraph can be given in parameter, in that case reverse
  only the direction of edges belonging to it
:type graph: :class:`tlp.Graph`
