tlp.SimpleTest.isSimple(graph,directed = false)

Returns :const:`True` if the graph is simple (i.e. it contains no self loops or parallel edges),
:const:`False` otherwise.

:param graph: the graph on which to perform the simple test
:type graph: :class:`tlp.Graph`

:type directed: boolean
:rtype: boolean

  static void makeSimple(tlp::Graph* graph, std::vector<tlp::edge> &removed /Out/, bool directed = false) ;
%Docstring
tlp.SimpleTest.makeSimple(graph,directed = false)

Makes the graph  simple by removing self loops and parallel edges if any.
Returns a list of removed edges.

:param graph: the graph to make simple
:type graph: :class:`tlp.Graph`
:param directed: Indicates if the graph should be considered as directed or not
:type directed: boolean
:rtype: list of :class:`tlp.edge`

%Docstring
tlp.SimpleTest.simpleTest(graph, bool directed = false)

Performs a simple test and returns a tuple with 3 elements. The first element is a boolean indicating the
result of the test. The second element is a list of found parallel edges. The third element is a list of
found self loops.

:param graph: the graph on which to perform the simple test
:type graph: :class:`tlp.Graph`
:param directed: Indicates if the graph should be considered as directed or not
:type directed: boolean
:rtype: (boolean, list of :class:`tlp.edge`, list of :class:`tlp.edge`)
